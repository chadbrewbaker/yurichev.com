_HEADER_HL1(`TAOCP 7.1.3 Exercise 198, UTF-8 encoding and program synthesis by sketching')

<p>Found this exercise in TAOCP 7.1.3 (Bitwise Tricks and Techniques):</p>

<p><img src="TAOCP_713_198.png" class="ImageBorder" /></p>

<p>This is like program synthesis by sketching: you give a sketch with several "holes" missing and ask some
automated software to fill the "holes".
In our case, a,b and c are "holes".</p>

<p>Let's find them using Z3:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
m4_include(`blog/TAOCP_713_198/198.py')
_PRE_END

<p>I tried various bit widths for a, b and c and found that 22 bits are enough.
I've lots of results like:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
...

a,b,c = 0x250100 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x258100 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x258900 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x250900 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x251100 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x259100 0x3 0x381416
a,b,c = 0x259100 0x3 0x389416
a,b,c = 0x251100 0x3 0x389416
a,b,c = 0x251100 0x3 0x189416
a,b,c = 0x259100 0x3 0x189416
a,b,c = 0x259100 0x3 0x189016

...
_PRE_END

<p>It seems that several least significant bits of a and c are not used.
After little experimentation, I've come to this:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
...

# make a,c more aesthetically appealing:
s.add((a&0xffff)==0)
s.add((c&0xffff00)==0)

...
_PRE_END

<p>And the results:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0x36
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0x16
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0x96
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0xd6
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0xf6
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0x76
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0xb6
a,b,c = 0x250000 0x3 0x56
results total= 8
_PRE_END

<p>Pick any.</p>

<p>But how it works?
Its operation is very similar to the bitwise trick related to leading/trailing zero bits counting based on De Bruijn sequences.
