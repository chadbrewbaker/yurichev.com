_PRE_BEGIN
In combinatorial mathematics, the ménage problem or problème des ménages[1] asks for the number of different ways in which
it is possible to seat a set of male-female couples at a dining table so that men and women alternate and nobody sits next 
to his or her partner. This problem was formulated in 1891 by Édouard Lucas and independently, a few years earlier, 
by Peter Guthrie Tait in connection with knot theory.[2] For a number of couples equal to 3, 4, 5, ... 
the number of seating arrangements is

    12, 96, 3120, 115200, 5836320, 382072320, 31488549120, ... (sequence A059375 in the OEIS).

<p>We are getting "half" of results because men and women can be then swapped (their sex swapped (or reassigned)) and you've got another 6 results.
6+6=12 in total.
This is kind of symmetry.</p>
