_HEADER_HL1(`Can rand() generate 10 consecutive zeroes?')

<p>I've always been wondering, if it's possible or not.
As of simplest linear congruential generator from MSVC's rand(), I could get a state at which rand() will output 8 zeroes modulo 10:</p>

[state3 = 1181667981,
 state4 = 342792988,
 state5 = 4116856175,
 state7 = 1741999969,
 state8 = 3185636512,
 state2 = 1478548498,
 state6 = 4036911734,
 state1 = 286227003,
 state9 = 1700675811]
_PRE_END

<p>This is a case if, in some video game, you'll find a code:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
for (int i=0; i<8; i++)
    printf ("%d\n", rand() % 10);
_PRE_END

<p>... and at some point, this piece of code can generate 8 zeroes in row, if the state will be 286227003 (decimal).</p>

Just checked this piece of code in MSVC 2015:

_PRE_BEGIN
// MSVC 2015 x86

#include &lt;stdio.h>

int main()
{
	srand(286227003);

	for (int i=0; i<8; i++)
		printf ("%d\n", rand() % 10);
};
_PRE_END

<p>Yes, its output is 8 zeroes!</p>

<p>What about other modulos?</p>

<p>I can get 4 consecutive zeroes modulo 100:</p>

_PRE_BEGIN
m4_include(`blog/LCG_Z3//LCG100.py')
_PRE_END

 state2 = 1055176198,
 state1 = 3865742399,
 state5 = 1389375667]
_PRE_END

<p>However, 4 consecutive zeroes modulo 100 is impossible (given these constants at least), this gives "unsat":
_HTML_LINK_AS_IS(`https://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/LCG_Z3/LCG100_v1.py').</p>

<p>... and 3 consecutive zeroes modulo 1000:</p>

<p>What if we could use rand()'s output without division? Which is in 0..0x7fff range (i.e., 15 bits)?
As it can be checked quickly, 2 zeroes at output is possible:</p>

_HL2(`UNIX time and srand(time(NULL))')

<p>Given the fact that it's highly popular to initialize LCG PRNG with UNIX time (i.e., <b>srand(time(NULL))</b>), you can probably calculate a moment in time so that LCG PRNG will be initialized as you want to.</p>

<p>For example, can we get a moment in time from now (5-Dec-2017) till 12-Dec-2017 (that is one week from now), when, if initialized by UNIX time, rand() will output as many similar numbers (modulo 10), as possible?</p>

Yes:

_PRE_BEGIN
sat
[state3 = 2234253076,
 state4 = 497021319,
 state5 = 4160988718,
 c = 3,
 state2 = 333151205,
 state6 = 46785593,
 state1 = 1512500810,
 state7 = 1158878744]
_PRE_END

<p>If <b>srand(time(NULL))</b> will be executed at <b>Tue Dec  5 21:06:50 EET 2017</b> (this precise second, UNIX time=1512500810), a next 6 <b>rand() %10</b> lines will output six numbers of 3 in a row.
Don't know if it useful or not, but you've got the idea.</p>

<p>See also: _HTML_LINK(`https://yurichev.com/blog//compress/',`Text strings right in the middle of compressed data').
Also, my _HTML_LINK(`https://yurichev.com/writings/SAT_SMT_draft-EN.pdf',`SAT/SMT notes') has another LCG-related example.</p>

<p>Further work: check glibc's rand(), Mersenne Twister, etc. Simple 32-bit LCG as described can be checked using simple brute-force, I think.</p>
