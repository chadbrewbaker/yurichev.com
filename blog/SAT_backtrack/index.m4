<p>
This is simplest possible backtracking SAT solver written in Python (not a DPLL one).
It uses the same backtracking algorithm you can find in many simple Sudoku and 8 queens solvers.
It works significantly slower, but due to its extreme simplicity, it can also count solutions.
For example, it count all solutions of _HTML_LINK(`https://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/SAT_backtrack/queens8.cnf',`8 queens problem').
Also, there are 70 solutions for _HTML_LINK(`https://github.com/DennisYurichev/yurichev.com/blob/master/blog/SAT_backtrack/POPCNT4.cnf',`POPCNT4 function') (the function is true if any 4 of its input 8 variables are true):</p>

<p>It was also tested on _HTML_LINK(`https://yurichev.com/blog/minesweeper_SAT/',`my Minesweeper cracker'), and finishes in reasonable time (though, slower than MiniSat by a factor of ~10).</p>

<p>On bigger CNF instances, it gets stuck.</p>

<p>As you can see, all it does is enumerate all possible solutions, but prunes search tree as early as possible. This is backtracking.</p>
